# GeoCoding-And-Reverse-GeoCoding
Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.
Various APIs available for this. Here we have used Google API, OpenCage GeoCoder, Geopy for GeoCoding and Reverse Geocoding.
